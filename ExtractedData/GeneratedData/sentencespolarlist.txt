the location of the hotel is perfect for the night life and the beach is only a short walk away
location:
right outside the tito's lane. {'neu': 0.866, 'pos': 0.134, 'compound': 0.5719, 'neg': 0.0}
this is very central to the baga party area.--------------------- {'neu': 0.748, 'pos': 0.252, 'compound': 0.4019, 'neg': 0.0}

hotel/property:
besides the reception and probably the kitchen, nothing is to great about this property. {'neu': 0.81, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.5096, 'neg': 0.19}
it seems to be old and ill maintained property - broken hinges, unbalanced chairs, leaking facets are norm (we had 4 rooms so i could easily compare). {'neu': 0.71, 'pos': 0.091, 'compound': -0.4976, 'neg': 0.199}
the exterior of rooms is quite green and nice, but room built (at least for v block i stayed in) was poor. {'neu': 0.629, 'pos': 0.075, 'compound': -0.7887, 'neg': 0.296}
there are 2 swimming pools, but it seems that they have outdated (or non-existent) cleaning systems. {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
we went in the first day and came out with burning eyes (very high chlorine). {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
we complained and .. well, nothing happened - same story the next day. {'neu': 0.676, 'pos': 0.142, 'compound': -0.1531, 'neg': 0.182}
food:
we had breakfast as part of our deal.---------------------- {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
it was just an average fair.------------------------------------- {'neu': 0.685, 'pos': 0.315, 'compound': 0.3182, 'neg': 0.0}
the spread was adequate (continental, india, etc), but overall quality, hygiene was not great. {'neu': 0.671, 'pos': 0.081, 'compound': -0.6112, 'neg': 0.248}
it seems that the food is more to the taste of foreign tourists (which the hotel had plenty). {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
overall, it is avoidable.---------------------------------------- {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
there are good eateries outside (being in a congested area, baga) which one can go to if you can save money here. {'neu': 0.757, 'pos': 0.243, 'compound': 0.7269, 'neg': 0.0}
service:
this is one of the biggest let-down for us.------------- {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
the service guys are indifferent; polite, but indifferent.------- {'neu': 0.625, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.3818, 'neg': 0.375}
it seems for them the tourist didn't exist.---------------------- {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
(or maybe, it is one of those places where being and indian in india is a disadvantage (foreign tourist were served well it seems - just my perception, though). {'neu': 0.836, 'pos': 0.07, 'compound': -0.1779, 'neg': 0.094}
you ask something and all you get is either a stare, or simply no acknowledgement - even though they might not refuse you. {'neu': 0.823, 'pos': 0.082, 'compound': -0.0803, 'neg': 0.095}
(imaging cleaning services asking us - do you need hand towels in bathroom? {'neu': 0.775, 'pos': 0.225, 'compound': 0.4939, 'neg': 0.0}
- on the first day itself)
other than that, there were glaring examples of service staff ignoring us and i will not inflate this review by adding all of them here - summary: it was bad experience. {'neu': 0.838, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.7351, 'neg': 0.162}
one experience is worth sharing, though:
we asked for king bed in some of our rooms and double bed in others. {'neu': 0.802, 'pos': 0.198, 'compound': 0.5719, 'neg': 0.0}
imagine, we reaching the rooms and finding all double beds.------ {'neu': 0.833, 'pos': 0.167, 'compound': 0.2023, 'neg': 0.0}
the reception was polite enough to answer - please join the beds, they will become king beds. {'neu': 0.757, 'pos': 0.243, 'compound': 0.5423, 'neg': 0.0}
we couldn't stop laughing, pitying ourselves for choosing this property. {'neu': 0.517, 'pos': 0.29, 'compound': 0.0762, 'neg': 0.194}
(there are many more but it simply is a spiral down).------------ {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
my take:
- i will probably never stay here irrespective of the discount they give me. {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
it simply is not worth it.--------------------------------------- {'neu': 0.75, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.1695, 'neg': 0.25}
- only reason i would recommend anyone this property (probably someone who is not close ;p), in case they are looking for right-in-middle-of-party-scene location. {'neu': 0.894, 'pos': 0.106, 'compound': 0.3612, 'neg': 0.0}
- approach itself is so crowded that you will feel sad you hired a car. {'neu': 0.795, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.4767, 'neg': 0.205}
my suggestion: hire bike till you can.--------------------------- {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
i thought of rating 'poor' but 1) i selected this hotel even after reading reviews so essentially it was my fault and 2) location overrides almost all the other worst part - thus, average. {'neu': 0.759, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.8807, 'neg': 0.241}
great hotel with genuine friendly and helpful staff nothing is too much trouble for them

we reached saturday night in our own vehicle and found it very difficult to park our xylo...no one to guide us, you see! {'neu': 0.824, 'pos': 0.055, 'compound': -0.3989, 'neg': 0.121}
but the bright lights outside and live music being played inside, already brought me into a celebratory mood..
of course the receptionist was i his usual dreary mood..( he seems to be absolutely devoid of emotion all the time... nothing to do with our stay,so fine with it!) {'neu': 0.77, 'pos': 0.173, 'compound': 0.7463, 'neg': 0.057}
we were escorted to our room g03, which was pool facing and wonderful and ultimately we were able to relax...
we were guided to the vegetarian buffet which was good...( take a package deal with food if you want, it works out cheaper)
after a good night's rest, we had breakfast, which was de very good..( but breakfast can be a messy affair at times, i mean the wonderful buffet breakfast, food disappears so fast, you may be reminded of your hostel canteen! {'neu': 0.81, 'pos': 0.12, 'compound': 0.5334, 'neg': 0.07}

baga beach is just a five minute walk from ronil's..that's one of the reasons i like it so much..
well, here comes the interesting part..we wanted to extend our stay, so we were given a room called i 02... hmmm... an experience in itself is..... cobwebs, no hot water in the bathtub...insects we had never seen before...but housekeeping was so very good, that the moment we brought this to their attention,it was fixed! {'neu': 0.805, 'pos': 0.167, 'compound': 0.8702, 'neg': 0.028}

specify to the chef what your requirement is , actually, and the dish is prepared.. call housekeeping, they respond immediately...so definitely a good stay..the two pools don't have lifeguards, but still fine..so, if you want to stay at ronil's, go ahead.. but make sure you tell them what exactly you want from them before hand..and a few reminders of the same would definitely not hurt!! {'neu': 0.759, 'pos': 0.241, 'compound': 0.9377, 'neg': 0.0}

to start with :
- absolutely clueless and non-responsive front desk
- utter unhygienic rooms and washrooms
- no sens of guest services with any of the staff members
- no regards to guest complaint. {'neu': 0.735, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.8122, 'neg': 0.265}
i checked in with my wife and 2 year old son late in the evening. {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
to my utter surprise the pathetic air conditioner which was already huffing and puffing to keep the smallest room i have ever seen stopped working in the midnight. {'neu': 0.757, 'pos': 0.066, 'compound': -0.5423, 'neg': 0.177}
despite repeated calls to front desk, no body bothered to come and check it and i had to walk down myself to talks some sense to them. {'neu': 0.842, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.5423, 'neg': 0.158}
now even after repeated attempts they failed to rectify the problem and made us change the room in those wee hours. {'neu': 0.76, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.7184, 'neg': 0.24}
now comes the surprise, they allotted us a room with two single beds joined together and requested us to adjust till morning as no rooms are available. {'neu': 0.848, 'pos': 0.074, 'compound': -0.0258, 'neg': 0.078}
i had enough of this drama and blasted them left right and center and voila, a room with a double bed appeared out of nowhere. {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}

after a very stressful flight to goa due to the thomson flight been delayed 24 hours our rooms very ready for us on our arrival, stayed in this hotel 2 years ago, and just returned home today, was a bit worried about some of the reviews up to us going but was not disappointed in the slightest, the requests we made to the hotel before our arrival were met as travelled this year with friends and family, we stayed in room c04, room was ground floor, yes they could do with a lick of paint, the towels were changed on a daily basis and the bedding every other day, the beds were as comfortable as ever, bottles of water left daily, and our cleaner was fantastic what a great friendly guy he was, the ground staff and security men always had a cheerful smile on greeting you every morning, breakfast this year was also better than the previous year, as bacon was available on request and very nice it was. {'neu': 0.698, 'pos': 0.277, 'compound': 0.9954, 'neg': 0.025}
my only criticism was the bar staff were a little stand offish and the bar closed promptly at 11pm every night and there was no give what so ever, all in all a lovely little gem of a hotel, just needs a lick of paint that's all, would highly recommend this hotel
we had been at ronil keys goa for 4 nights from 17 march 2016 to 21 march 2016,just want to tell you guys had been to goa many times ,but it was our 1 time we had stayed at ronil keys goa ,the location is perfect you won't find a better hotel then this at this location just near by beach , night life almost every thing nearby,the food is mind blowing guys rights from the breakfast to diner everything we eat was wow, the rooms were also good ,and last but not the least the staff was perfect right from the manager to cleaning guys all were very helpful they had given us early checkin to late checkouts as our flight was late at evining just by one request they had given us late checkout i don't think any hotel in goa would do this for there customers , had received the perfect hospitality from ronil keys goa,thank you guys for perfect vacation would defiantly come again . {'neu': 0.812, 'pos': 0.16, 'compound': 0.9884, 'neg': 0.027}

it was 2 floors up at the rear of the hotel with not much of a view but after nearly 20 hours travelling was treated by us as an oasis. {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}

unfortunately, in our opinion what is needed is for a deeper clean of the fan, ac unit and up in the corners of the ceilings. {'neu': 0.739, 'pos': 0.176, 'compound': 0.3818, 'neg': 0.085}
it is badly in need of a coat of paint just to freshen the place up. {'neu': 0.819, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.4767, 'neg': 0.181}

the two pools really need some filtration system installed as dust and dead insects begin to take over as the day goes on. {'neu': 0.837, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.6486, 'neg': 0.163}
we found the pool area to be a wee bit too hot so headed off to the beach shacks during the day and caught the sea breezes to stay cool. {'neu': 0.924, 'pos': 0.076, 'compound': 0.3182, 'neg': 0.0}

as long as you remember which country you are in and make some small allowances you will enjoy this hotel. {'neu': 0.856, 'pos': 0.144, 'compound': 0.4939, 'neg': 0.0}
we did and will probably return next year.----------------------- {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
the location is ideal, near to the beach and restaurants in abundance. {'neu': 0.764, 'pos': 0.236, 'compound': 0.5267, 'neg': 0.0}
the rooms are a little dated, sheets are a bit threadbare and wardrobe space is limited. {'neu': 0.872, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.2263, 'neg': 0.128}
the hotel is clean, not spotless.-------------------------------- {'neu': 0.649, 'pos': 0.351, 'compound': 0.4019, 'neg': 0.0}
you don't have the same person cleaning your room daily, they tend to move them around -we had 4 different people cleaning our room and some were far better than others. {'neu': 0.909, 'pos': 0.091, 'compound': 0.4404, 'neg': 0.0}
it also makes it difficult for tipping because you don't know when they move them. {'neu': 0.848, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.3612, 'neg': 0.152}
breakfast is fine if you want to eat indian style, we stuck with cornflakes each morning. {'neu': 0.718, 'pos': 0.171, 'compound': 0.0258, 'neg': 0.11}
meals in the evening cost no more than if you go outside to the restaurants and the food is good, we actually only ate in once because we found a few amazing restaurants and stuck with them. {'neu': 0.746, 'pos': 0.156, 'compound': 0.5423, 'neg': 0.098}
we had a few hiccups with the safety deposit box not working - eventually sorted after the fourth time and wasting a few hours waiting around for someone to call. {'neu': 0.82, 'pos': 0.092, 'compound': 0.0258, 'neg': 0.089}
it is well worth upgrading to a room overlooking the far pool as the rooms in the front are cramped and very, very noisy from the outside traffic which goes all night long. {'neu': 0.822, 'pos': 0.113, 'compound': 0.1849, 'neg': 0.064}
a massive downside was that we weren't being picked up until late on the evening of leaving. {'neu': 0.882, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.25, 'neg': 0.118}
we requested to keep our room but we weren't allowed to do so until the morning of check out - if they could sell the room then they would and they do not provide any provisions for a shower, you can leave your cases near reception but it is not secure. {'neu': 0.924, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.4318, 'neg': 0.076}
this did spoil the last couple of days of our holiday, not knowing if we were going to be turfed out at 11am and we even went looking for a room nearby which we could book for the day - we found one for £15 but did not need it in the end as the hotel was not full. {'neu': 0.968, 'pos': 0.032, 'compound': 0.2144, 'neg': 0.0}
i have never been to any hotel where they do not provide at least a shower room and feel the hotel need to look at this. {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
there is free wi-fi in the hotel but found it very hit and miss but all the bars have it anyway and the service is much better. {'neu': 0.743, 'pos': 0.186, 'compound': 0.5725, 'neg': 0.071}

i will start with the concerns:
1.------------------------------- {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
irritating housekeeping staff - we were welcomed by the noise, chatter and various sounds of housekeeping staff just outside our room. {'neu': 0.769, 'pos': 0.103, 'compound': -0.1531, 'neg': 0.128}
it went on for 2 hours and we told them a couple of times.------- {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
later, we understood that the area outside our room is the gathering area for the staff. {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
we were in the room on 2 afternoons and both the days the story was same. {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
i had asked the reception to interfere and they helped us to some extent in this. {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
this is a very innovative way of disturbing somebody who is seeking some peace on a holiday. {'neu': 0.464, 'pos': 0.396, 'compound': 0.7264, 'neg': 0.139}
2.--------------------------------------------------------------- {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
material warehouse in front of room - more than half of the times when we opened our room door, we were greeted by housekeeping material like towels, cleaning material, dustbins right in front of our door. {'neu': 0.878, 'pos': 0.122, 'compound': 0.5574, 'neg': 0.0}

i could clearly see the error due to authentication problem but the staff insisted that there is a technical error in the wifi instrument. {'neu': 0.664, 'pos': 0.068, 'compound': -0.6597, 'neg': 0.268}

they still wanted us to wait for half a day more, but when we insisted, they offered us guest logins and the net started working. {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
now, this kind of behaviour is very hard to digest.-------------- {'neu': 0.842, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.1761, 'neg': 0.158}
why would they not want to not authenticate somebody?------------ {'neu': 0.867, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.0572, 'neg': 0.133}
does the management want only some of the "preferred" guests to use the wifi? {'neu': 0.909, 'pos': 0.091, 'compound': 0.0772, 'neg': 0.0}
or the connectivity is so terrible that they cant connect everybody? {'neu': 0.715, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.6113, 'neg': 0.285}
whatever is the case, discreetly disconnecting somebody and giving false reasons is a big turn off. {'neu': 0.854, 'pos': 0.146, 'compound': 0.34, 'neg': 0.0}

mixed feeling for this hotel
the room was clean, adequate but short on storage space for 2 people. {'neu': 0.755, 'pos': 0.245, 'compound': 0.3716, 'neg': 0.0}
no problem at all with the quality and variety of food from breakfast (buffet) to evening meal we were never disappointed. {'neu': 0.707, 'pos': 0.1, 'compound': -0.3283, 'neg': 0.193}
the hotel area is quiet and reasonably maintained but the large swimming pool filter did not work at all during our three week stay which meant that by the second week the pool did not seem very appealing. {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
the service was acceptable but it is advisable to make friends early on in your stay with a couple of the waiters to ensure a decent level of service. {'neu': 0.723, 'pos': 0.277, 'compound': 0.8481, 'neg': 0.0}
the hotel bar closes at 11.00pm prompt but there are bars and restaurants close by so it was not a problem. {'neu': 0.868, 'pos': 0.132, 'compound': 0.438, 'neg': 0.0}
literally the taxi rank is outside of the hotel and would advise that you chat to a few people to get an idea of the prices (as they differ greatly) and make friends with a taxi driver and use him for all of your journeys (this cuts down on the hassle) every time you leave the hotel. {'neu': 0.889, 'pos': 0.053, 'compound': 0.1779, 'neg': 0.058}
there is wifi and although the accessibility can fluctuate throughout the day, sometimes it appears you can not access it from your room but keep trying, we were the furthest away from the hotel reception but after a few attempts it was possible. {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
the room service was good, the beds comfortable and towels were changed daily, complimentary water is provided with tea, coffe, milk replenished daily. {'neu': 0.687, 'pos': 0.313, 'compound': 0.8442, 'neg': 0.0}

some fresh observations:

1) the breakfast spread had marginal improvements and tasted much better
2) the crowd management at breakfast could be improved although we stayed at the resort during a long weekend and the resort was packed. {'neu': 0.757, 'pos': 0.243, 'compound': 0.8625, 'neg': 0.0}
it was difficult to get tables between 930 am to 10 am
3) the free wifi connection was hopelessly slow
4) on one day the housekeeping cleaned our rooms at 4 pm - which was an irritant since we had to wait in the lobby for our room to get cleaned
5) stayed in room i03 - the shower was very low - bumped my head into the shower faucet a few times
6) the bathroom did not have adequate hooks to hang towels / clothes

on the positive side, the hotel offered us reasonably early check at 11 am after our early morning flight into goa. {'neu': 0.815, 'pos': 0.07, 'compound': -0.6198, 'neg': 0.114}

(2) the rooms are pretty average with no privacy.---------------- {'neu': 0.565, 'pos': 0.258, 'compound': 0.25, 'neg': 0.177}

(5) the day trip arranged to go to south goa by ac coach was a waste of time as apart from 4 spots mentioned on the list to visit the guide took us to places not worth wasting time on and not mentioned on the list of places to visit (as we believe he got commissions from the venue owners) and in the end he took us to a place for cruise on a river which would take 2 hours of people not interested to go and then an hour to reach the hotel so we ended up taking a taxi back to the hotel. {'neu': 0.903, 'pos': 0.032, 'compound': -0.5213, 'neg': 0.065}

the receptionist then told us there was no rooms available at this point i asked to speak to the manager as mr austin had promised us a room, i explained to the manager that mr austin had promised us a room on departure and it would be sorted, he asked us to come back in 30 mins as mr austin has to look at the arrivals to see if we could have a room, when we got back we was allowed to keep our room on which we was grateful for ...... if mr a is the only person that can sort rooms out what would happen if he was unable to attend work one day???? {'neu': 0.905, 'pos': 0.076, 'compound': 0.7757, 'neg': 0.019}

it's cheaper fresh food and cold beers at next to nothing with free unlimited wifi which is great competitive attractions if ronil manager can adopt modern thinking to retain customers within the resort. {'neu': 0.638, 'pos': 0.298, 'compound': 0.8359, 'neg': 0.064}
it's false tunnel vision as by charging 100 rupees per hour for wifi people are not going to stay within the resort to be comfortable to chill and contact family by free wifi, they will buy ten beers, food and tip staff very generously as we tourist are. {'neu': 0.79, 'pos': 0.21, 'compound': 0.8932, 'neg': 0.0}
i stayed here from 11-14th dec 2014 for a college reunion ,

location : i would say it is decent locations very near to baga beach, though you don't have direct access to beach or vision of amazing sea, still you are in the heart of the market , with 24hrs grocery store open in front of you with an atm machine, which makes it very convenient. {'neu': 0.91, 'pos': 0.09, 'compound': 0.7003, 'neg': 0.0}
its hardly 5-10 minutes walk to beach.you are walking distance 5-7 minutes from happening night clubs and its enjoyable. {'neu': 0.861, 'pos': 0.139, 'compound': 0.4404, 'neg': 0.0}
we were very close to sukhoi thai spa and if you are not expecting any stupid spa services , then this is the best place to go , they will give you very relaxing massage therapy , which is with aromatic oils for feet up to thighs and dry massage with pressure points for upper body, very authentic and relaxing

ambience : it is beautiful inside with access to swimming pool, so if you dont want to go to beach you can have a good sun bath inside the resort relaxing next to swimming pool, which is well maintained.you can also indulge in reading novels, or indoor games like pool and carrom board. {'neu': 0.75, 'pos': 0.223, 'compound': 0.9786, 'neg': 0.026}
rooms : rooms are well furnished with decent ambience and comfort for a leisure traveller, soaps, moisturisers etc provided in room are good quality and beds are comfortable to sleep. {'neu': 0.69, 'pos': 0.31, 'compound': 0.8689, 'neg': 0.0}
service: the hotel staff is very courteous , and service is not bad, morning food spread is not bad, though they strictly stop services at 10:30 for breakfast and it is pretty crowded, this is one segment where they can improve, by at least allowing people to finish there breakfast, once they have reached before 10:30.

every evening there are local bands or singers performing along the pool side and it is enjoyable to have music while having dinner or drinks. {'neu': 0.767, 'pos': 0.21, 'compound': 0.9476, 'neg': 0.023}
i would say it was a good experience staying at the keys resort.- {'neu': 0.775, 'pos': 0.225, 'compound': 0.4404, 'neg': 0.0}
i had stayed in this hotel from 06th to 10th december 2014 with my wife and had booked after reading mostly positive reviews on tripadvisor and looking up the information and pictures that were published on the keys website. {'neu': 0.911, 'pos': 0.089, 'compound': 0.5574, 'neg': 0.0}
however, i must say that except for the location of the hotel and maybe the service to some extent, there isn't anything else that is really positive about this place. {'neu': 0.878, 'pos': 0.122, 'compound': 0.5984, 'neg': 0.0}
we booked the standard room which looks pretty decent on the keys website but we were shocked upon checking-in to find out that the room we were given was nowhere near to what was published on their website. {'neu': 0.877, 'pos': 0.051, 'compound': -0.2144, 'neg': 0.072}
this room number was a6 so beware if you ever get this room or anything similar to this. {'neu': 0.929, 'pos': 0.071, 'compound': 0.0772, 'neg': 0.0}
the room literally finishes even before it begins.--------------- {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
this was also mentioned in someone else's post here on tripadvisor but i did not expect it to be true. {'neu': 0.829, 'pos': 0.171, 'compound': 0.5719, 'neg': 0.0}
we immediately brought this to the notice of the front desk who were not very helpful and so we asked to speak to the general manager of the hotel who is mr. dennis d'costa. {'neu': 0.928, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.3713, 'neg': 0.072}
mr. d'costa was not in the property at that time and called us after an hour or so and recommended that we see another room (s5) and if we are comfortable then we can be shifted / upgraded to that room. {'neu': 0.876, 'pos': 0.124, 'compound': 0.6573, 'neg': 0.0}
we were happy and thankful to be upgraded but had mentioned to mr. d'costa that we would still like to meet him to discuss other feedback to which he promised to meet us later in the day or during our stay. {'neu': 0.768, 'pos': 0.232, 'compound': 0.8807, 'neg': 0.0}

there are many issues with this hotel and one which is very evident is the lack of communication and co-ordination between the keys management and owners. {'neu': 0.916, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.3182, 'neg': 0.084}
my wife and i being hotelier ourselves noticed this disconnect immediately while speaking to the staff at the front desk about the discrepancies with the product sold to customers as compared to what is published on their website. {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
for example -

it seems that there was more of a touch up or quick fix up job rather than an actual renovation. {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}

these were points noticed at the time of check-in itself and i am sure at this rate there would be a lot more feedback to give but fortunately for us and the hotel, we spent most of our time outside the hotel discovering goa. {'neu': 0.961, 'pos': 0.039, 'compound': 0.1655, 'neg': 0.0}
these were few points that we brought up to the ms. vaishali (hope i remembered the name right) from front desk / sales who agreed to the discrepancies but flatly told us to bring it up to the general manager and that the website is handled by the keys head office in mumbai and so not in their control. {'neu': 0.973, 'pos': 0.027, 'compound': 0.1406, 'neg': 0.0}
the disconnect between management and owners is clear here.------ {'neu': 0.755, 'pos': 0.245, 'compound': 0.3818, 'neg': 0.0}
so does this make it ok to publish wrong information on your website?? {'neu': 0.66, 'pos': 0.132, 'compound': -0.3094, 'neg': 0.208}
this isn't helpful information to a guest and this isn't ethical business procedures. {'neu': 0.665, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.6167, 'neg': 0.335}
the staff at the coffee shop however provided good service and remembered our daily requests - for example, my wife has a warm glass of water first thing in the morning before starting her day and since we could not use the stinking flask in the room, we had to come down to the restaurant and request this from the staff there. {'neu': 0.883, 'pos': 0.117, 'compound': 0.7633, 'neg': 0.0}

housekeeping was to a good standard rooms cleaned daily and always fresh towels and 2 bottles of water provided. {'neu': 0.743, 'pos': 0.257, 'compound': 0.6369, 'neg': 0.0}
wifi is available for a reasonable cost and worked in the room too though it is free in most beach shacks and some bars and i think it's time hotels did this too. {'neu': 0.901, 'pos': 0.099, 'compound': 0.5106, 'neg': 0.0}
evening entertainment is provided from 7.30 until 10.30 usually a singer but once (i think friday)was some indian dancers who were very entertaining but most people go out in the evening so often playing to a small audience. {'neu': 0.789, 'pos': 0.211, 'compound': 0.8319, 'neg': 0.0}
our return flight was 2am so requested a late checkout and were able to keep the room until 7pm for a £15 charge. {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}

this is a mixed review and based on a two week stay finishing on nov 29th 2014. {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
like the curate's egg, the hotel was good in parts.-------------- {'neu': 0.597, 'pos': 0.403, 'compound': 0.6597, 'neg': 0.0}
location-wise it's perfect, right on the strip and handy for everything you could want. {'neu': 0.706, 'pos': 0.294, 'compound': 0.6124, 'neg': 0.0}
reception was also pretty good although when it came to a complaint (about which more later) the traditional indian habit of suddenly losing command of the english language reared its ugly head. {'neu': 0.647, 'pos': 0.152, 'compound': -0.25, 'neg': 0.201}
the bar was very good and reasonably priced, given that it is after all a hotel. {'neu': 0.814, 'pos': 0.186, 'compound': 0.4927, 'neg': 0.0}
the restaurant was pretty good, too.----------------------------- {'neu': 0.396, 'pos': 0.604, 'compound': 0.7269, 'neg': 0.0}
we stayed b&b and breakfasts were adequate - eggs, toast, cereal, fruit, porridge for the western guests plus a range of asian foods for the indian guests. {'neu': 0.927, 'pos': 0.073, 'compound': 0.2263, 'neg': 0.0}
we had a couple of light lunches which were ok - all that we needed, anyway. {'neu': 0.855, 'pos': 0.145, 'compound': 0.296, 'neg': 0.0}
the staff were excellent.---------------------------------------- {'neu': 0.448, 'pos': 0.552, 'compound': 0.5719, 'neg': 0.0}
the hotel has two pools the larger, sunnier pool is at the front and the smaller more sheltered pool at the rear. {'neu': 0.864, 'pos': 0.136, 'compound': 0.5106, 'neg': 0.0}
we preferred the rear pool simply because of the water condition - it seemed much cleaner, the front pool had a film on the surface largely due to lazy people not showering away their suntan oil before getting into the water. {'neu': 0.898, 'pos': 0.041, 'compound': -0.2023, 'neg': 0.061}
all well so far but the room was a big problem.------------------ {'neu': 0.611, 'pos': 0.118, 'compound': -0.4588, 'neg': 0.271}
the first room we were given was g8 which seemed ok until you opened up the curtain and went onto the balcony where you were greeted with the sight of a rubbish dump. {'neu': 0.808, 'pos': 0.12, 'compound': 0.1779, 'neg': 0.072}
this was, in fact, the back garden of a private house so there's not a lot that could be done about that. {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
the kicker for g8 was the fact that as soon as night fell a swarm of tiny white spiders appeared on the wall behind the bed head. {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
so we had to change rooms.--------------------------------------- {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
after being handed from one clerk to another (then another, then another) we were shown some other rooms. {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
firstly we were offered g1 which was much smaller and a ground floor room that was right on the main walkway. {'neu': 0.888, 'pos': 0.112, 'compound': 0.34, 'neg': 0.0}
the we were offered v22 which was much more to our expectations, or v21 which had a pool view. {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
we settled on v21 with a pool view but of course had to stump up an upgrade fee of something like gbp 40 per week. {'neu': 0.876, 'pos': 0.124, 'compound': 0.5023, 'neg': 0.0}
cleaning and housekeeping were excellent.------------------------ {'neu': 0.519, 'pos': 0.481, 'compound': 0.5719, 'neg': 0.0}
entertainment was better than i would have expected although there is a local government restriction on live music after 10.30 pm. {'neu': 0.672, 'pos': 0.239, 'compound': 0.5574, 'neg': 0.088}
so that's it for the hotel except just one thing to note - other reviews advise you to email mr dennis d'costa in advance and make your room requests know to him. {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
don't bother.---------------------------------------------------- {'neu': 0.329, 'pos': 0.671, 'compound': 0.2584, 'neg': 0.0}

our fellow guests were all there for the same reason, to enjoy the hotel, amenities and basically chill, the only downside to the this was a certain nationality who it seemed were not happy until they were totally inebriated and boisterous & playing the security guards by midnight swims. {'neu': 0.739, 'pos': 0.171, 'compound': 0.5426, 'neg': 0.09}
however the hotel did seem to promote the use of their laundry service which was rather pricey & boy was the internet charges really high and the package out dated. {'neu': 0.852, 'pos': 0.082, 'compound': 0.128, 'neg': 0.066}
it is a shame that keys resort didn't supply internet free for a period of 30 minutes per day so we could send quick messages to family back home, well we are in the 21st century. {'neu': 0.797, 'pos': 0.054, 'compound': -0.5722, 'neg': 0.149}
the food was hit and miss with no 2 meals being the same but no dehli belly though! {'neu': 0.7, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.6114, 'neg': 0.3}
would we go back to the hotel again possibly!-------------------- {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}

enjoyed our stay without a doubt .....
we purchased vouchers through groupon and weren't disappointed .... no underlined clauses to get scared of...the staff was really courteous and warm...we even got our the room with the pool view. {'neu': 0.655, 'pos': 0.284, 'compound': 0.8606, 'neg': 0.061}
the breakfast spread is decent with a live dosa counter....its a pity they dont serve goan pork sausages or bacon in the morning ...the food is super expensive for off season but i guess thats is what you get in baga....food is something which we didnt enjoy anywhere around baga... comparatively they serve better food in the hotel .....
this is also real close to tito's lane and the beach so thats another advantage
overall a very good place to stay

twice a day for around 5 minutes at a time, this means, either paying £2 a day (2 sessions) no big deal but having to enter a new 20 digit code and re-registering every time... not for me") your alternative would be to buy for the fortnight, that would be a whopping £80+). {'neu': 0.966, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.1531, 'neg': 0.034}

no, despite all the good points in the hotel, the staff being wonderful (special thanks to cruze in the restaurant), the wi-fi issue have meant that when we go back in february we wont be staying at the ronil, though we have booked nearby, shame but maybe that's just me. {'neu': 0.823, 'pos': 0.079, 'compound': -0.0137, 'neg': 0.098}

my room was in the j block at the back of the hotel with no noise from the outside, the room was large with a comfortable bed, good air conditioning and a ceiling fan, the only downside being that the balcony was on the small side. {'neu': 0.703, 'pos': 0.162, 'compound': 0.34, 'neg': 0.135}
the 2 pools were clean and well-tended with just enough sun loungers and sun umbrellas available, although maybe more loungers and less tables and chairs would be a good idea for the pools and garden spaces. {'neu': 0.851, 'pos': 0.149, 'compound': 0.6808, 'neg': 0.0}

the vouchers would cover a good meal but could not be used towards any drinks so that even if your meal was only 400 rupees and drinks were 100 you still had to pay the 100 as an extra and loose the 100 from the voucher. {'neu': 0.866, 'pos': 0.04, 'compound': -0.3818, 'neg': 0.094}

it is also hardly few meters away from baga beach, titos & mambos. {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
in recent years i have always stopped at lagoa azul in arpora but due to it being full i chose this resort for a change, so glad i did, this hotel is in baga and is central to everything going on outside which i loved, the hotel was pleasant the reception area was light airy and sociable, i travelled as a single person but met many people through out my stay here, i was pleasantly surprised by my room, it was compact but colourful, tea/coffee making facilities were a bonus and its the first hotel i have stopped in which did not have an antiquated television, the other bonus was having a safe in the bedroom, i must admit i did not eat breakfast here as i am addicted to coffee days which was just over the road, all in all a very pleasant stay and a special mention to the room cleaners who do a good job and are very friendly
great hotel, recommend it, we stayed for 2 weeks in february and paid extra for a balcony room, it was well worth it. {'neu': 0.659, 'pos': 0.324, 'compound': 0.9972, 'neg': 0.017}
my only criticism is that you had pay for the wifi, where every where else it's free including all the beach shacks and restaurants, why cannot the hotel be the same? {'neu': 0.787, 'pos': 0.093, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.121}
this is the second time we have stayed at ronil after comming to goa for 25 years and what a wonderfull stay we had,the improvements are excellent and the hotel is even better than last year even though we had no complaints then,once again thankyou to cruz for looking after us in the resteraunt you are a asset to the ronil.also what a wonderfull plane the dreamliner is.back to normal now but looking forward to staying at ronil again next year we couldnt fault it.keep up the good work and thanku to the management for our wonderfull stay.......rita n john wood. {'neu': 0.833, 'pos': 0.135, 'compound': 0.8746, 'neg': 0.032}
this was our fourth visit to goa and whilst we normally stay in candolim we decided to have a change this year and try baga. {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
i have to say that having now experienced baga our preference would lie with candolim. {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
for us baga is geared more for the younger generation especially the bars and clubs on tito lane which is very lively. {'neu': 0.868, 'pos': 0.132, 'compound': 0.4927, 'neg': 0.0}
in contrast the ronil provides a very comfortable quieter haven amongst the hustle and bustle of the area. {'neu': 0.817, 'pos': 0.183, 'compound': 0.5563, 'neg': 0.0}
the hotel location is excellent, tito's lane is virtually opposite where you can walk down to the beach in 5mins. {'neu': 0.837, 'pos': 0.163, 'compound': 0.5719, 'neg': 0.0}
turn right out of the hotel and you can walk to the beach at the end of the baga/calengute road(15/20mins) or turn left to calengute, it is walkable but a cab would be a better option for 100rp. {'neu': 0.901, 'pos': 0.099, 'compound': 0.5927, 'neg': 0.0}
prior to travelling out to goa we emailed a request for a pool view room in block v and we were not disappointed. {'neu': 0.767, 'pos': 0.109, 'compound': -0.089, 'neg': 0.124}
(see attached plan of ronil block layout).----------------------- {'neu': 0.674, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.4404, 'neg': 0.326}
the only criticism is that we were told that pool view rooms were regarded as an upgrade and we had to pay and extra £5.00 per day. {'neu': 0.853, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.5106, 'neg': 0.147}
also there are deluxe rooms available that will cost £10.00 per day extra. {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
whilst the room we had was brilliant we did feel a little aggrieved since we spoke with some residents that had pool views in other blocks and did not have to pay any extra. {'neu': 0.811, 'pos': 0.138, 'compound': 0.4932, 'neg': 0.051}

we found that this was not really a problem since the entertainment was rarely loud and finished around 10.30 to 11.00pm. {'neu': 0.773, 'pos': 0.227, 'compound': 0.6457, 'neg': 0.0}

the waiter service in general is excellent nothing is too much trouble and everyone is very friendly and accommodating. {'neu': 0.618, 'pos': 0.278, 'compound': 0.6697, 'neg': 0.104}
we were surprised by the lack of free wifi.---------------------- {'neu': 0.444, 'pos': 0.385, 'compound': 0.4404, 'neg': 0.17}
why the ronil feel the need to charge its residents for wifi connection when most bars and beach shacks offer it for free just seems to be a penny pinching exercise. {'neu': 0.898, 'pos': 0.102, 'compound': 0.5106, 'neg': 0.0}
the bar in reception closes at 11.00pm which we thought was a trifle early. {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}

surely its not unreasonable for residents to expect a later bar than that. {'neu': 0.791, 'pos': 0.209, 'compound': 0.4404, 'neg': 0.0}
the only major disappointment was on our day of departure.------- {'neu': 0.732, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.5106, 'neg': 0.268}

as things turned out our flight was delayed by 24 hours and somehow the hotel found us a room for the next day in block b (pool view) which we didn't have to vacate until 9.00pm. {'neu': 0.87, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.5859, 'neg': 0.13}
funny that.------------------------------------------------------ {'neu': 0.256, 'pos': 0.744, 'compound': 0.4404, 'neg': 0.0}
that said our overall experience of the keys resort-ronil was very good and we would not hesitate in recommending it to anyone travelling to baga. {'neu': 0.821, 'pos': 0.179, 'compound': 0.6133, 'neg': 0.0}
just a suggestion to mr d'costa: it might be useful to avoid confrontations with residents on arrival if you liaised travel agents and ask them to make it clear in their literature that there are different room rates. {'neu': 0.764, 'pos': 0.127, 'compound': 0.2023, 'neg': 0.109}
that way people could manage their expectations better.---------- {'neu': 0.707, 'pos': 0.293, 'compound': 0.4404, 'neg': 0.0}

have stayed at this hotel 3 years ago, there are a few changes, the lobby area much improved,
much better bar area, dining area moved around but much the same as before i thought the breakfast was an improvement from my last visit, choices where mixed fruits, eggs done to your choice boiled etc, porridge cornflakes toast etc etc, plus indian stuff i must admit didnt try but looked liked pancakes filled with rice & veg, to sum up on breakfast ample i thought, any problems with cleaned tables just tell staff on hand & one will be cleaned for you, well done boys cruz & gang, do think the open cooking area was a nice touch in the evening which is now missing shame. {'neu': 0.742, 'pos': 0.183, 'compound': 0.9201, 'neg': 0.075}
rooms, we were put in a room right on baga road which was very noisey day & night so told reception straight away, the room itself was very modern & well decorated, we were moved the first day to v block which i must say was much quieter but in need of modernization, peace outweighed noise, so thanks again captian philips & staff. {'neu': 0.775, 'pos': 0.196, 'compound': 0.9039, 'neg': 0.029}

just returned from the ronil and all i can say is fantastic,and thank you to all the staff for making our first visit to goa a memorable one.it certainly won't be our last(see you next year)
if you are reading this planning your first holiday to goa,remember where you are going,it's india not florida.go with an open mind.it can be a bit of a culture shock!!! {'neu': 0.84, 'pos': 0.123, 'compound': 0.7074, 'neg': 0.038}
we had 2 weeks there from march 23rd to april 7th and just wish we'd had more.the staff,from management to the chefs,housekeeping,waiters and pool attendants just couldn't do enough for us. {'neu': 0.915, 'pos': 0.085, 'compound': 0.4019, 'neg': 0.0}
the resort is perfectly situated in the ideal place to go wandering around the local shops,it's surrounded by too many amazing restaurants to name them all,and a mere 5 minute walk to the beach. {'neu': 0.718, 'pos': 0.282, 'compound': 0.9081, 'neg': 0.0}
our room,whilst being fairly basic was perfectly adequate,well what do need? {'neu': 0.704, 'pos': 0.296, 'compound': 0.6369, 'neg': 0.0}
it had a bed a tv a fridge and a bathroom with a shower.air con was a mercy but if you don't like it,turn it off and use the ceiling fan instead. {'neu': 0.757, 'pos': 0.155, 'compound': 0.2582, 'neg': 0.088}
the food was superb from a buffet style breakfast to a wide selection of lunches,and evening meals to suit all tastes. {'neu': 0.814, 'pos': 0.186, 'compound': 0.6249, 'neg': 0.0}
i'm not going to go on and on needlessly about this and that,although i could!!! {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
in my opinion,this is a gem of a resort,worth every penny and we'll be returning next year,but this time for 3 weeks because 2 weeks just wasn't enough. {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
a few tips:-amazing restaurants are within a hop skip and a jump of the resort,to name but a few....
jamies,fire and ice,brittos,east meets west,shining star(beach shack) and a 200 rupee ride away in calangute,try the buffalo burger at a new bistro called tamarin,amazing!!! {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
i'll review these on the restaurant section.--------------------- {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
if you want some clothes made seriously cheap,take your favourites,or pictures from your favourite book(next) etc and get them tailor made in a couple of days either at the on site shop,or turn right out of the resort,walk about 100 yards and you'll find one there on the right.from suits to leather jackets shirts the lot.i had 4 shirts made,£50.would have been £120-£160 in england. {'neu': 0.953, 'pos': 0.02, 'compound': -0.1027, 'neg': 0.027}
so anyway,i think you get the idea,well worth the money and we're counting down the days until we return. {'neu': 0.905, 'pos': 0.095, 'compound': 0.2263, 'neg': 0.0}

once we'd been shown a terrible room( dirty,broken insect screen,stained sheets) and though exhausted,gone through the well practised pantomime of asking for a better room and being shown a better room and a hugely better upgrade room,we opted for an upgrade which enabled us to stay here .the initial room was so bad that we would have sought alternative accommodation there and then.we learned from other guests that this is a commonly observed rigmarole at this place. {'neu': 0.782, 'pos': 0.128, 'compound': 0.2979, 'neg': 0.09}

the resort is a huge one with more than 100 rooms but the hotel service lacks the keys standard. {'neu': 0.912, 'pos': 0.088, 'compound': 0.1655, 'neg': 0.0}
the food is bad and expensive, i must say.----------------------- {'neu': 0.667, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.5423, 'neg': 0.333}

the resort has the potential to be one of calangute's best resort, with its huge space, 2 pools, close proximity to the beach, but they need to work on a lot of things to become the best. {'neu': 0.761, 'pos': 0.239, 'compound': 0.8765, 'neg': 0.0}

the manager felix, get's a little tetchy about offering you alternative rooms although over the christmas and new year period you have to appreciate that everywhere near baga beach tends to get over-booked as the whole of young india descends on baga for the xmas and new year beach parties. {'neu': 0.897, 'pos': 0.103, 'compound': 0.6597, 'neg': 0.0}
all in all, the visit was bearable made only so by the wonderful staff that work at this resort and the great food. {'neu': 0.723, 'pos': 0.277, 'compound': 0.8428, 'neg': 0.0}
i would also say that the hotel made an excellent effort for christmas and new year even though over the christmas period the entertainment was orientated towards the indian population even though they made up less than a third of the guests at the party. {'neu': 0.813, 'pos': 0.187, 'compound': 0.8481, 'neg': 0.0}
i understand the hotel is due for some kind of 'refurbishment' from april 2013 as it tries to upgrade it's status from a 2 star to a 3 star. {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
this wil be interesting, bearing in mind the totally outdated facilities offered in the rooms. {'neu': 0.838, 'pos': 0.162, 'compound': 0.4019, 'neg': 0.0}

those aiming for the ronil 'royale' which is next door need to be aware that this is not part of the same group - the hotel was split down the middle when the 2 partners parted ways. {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
for those that are visiting goa for the first time, i would say baga is for the younger generation as the beach area continues to deriorate into some kind of indian ibiza destination. {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}

stayed at this hotel for our second time nov/dec we emailed ahead and asked if it was possible to have a room in block j or v, having been delayed at gatwick for nearly 24 hrs thought we would be able to check straight in when we arrived (being as our room was booked and paid for from the sunday) but we were told our room wasn't ready we would have to wait, when we tried to explain that we had been delayed communication broke down completely. {'neu': 0.853, 'pos': 0.016, 'compound': -0.8646, 'neg': 0.131}
when we were eventually shown to a room it must have been the worst room they have, can't remember the room number but we had to use a lift and went down a dark corridor with mattresses stacked outside, took one look at the room and back to reception we went. {'neu': 0.926, 'pos': 0.023, 'compound': -0.34, 'neg': 0.051}
straight away we changed to a room that was far better and bigger,why couldn't they have given us this room first,
the rooms are cleaned every day with clean sheets and towels, however we found if you left a tip you got extra soap and toilet roll, we like to tip because we have good service not to get it. {'neu': 0.804, 'pos': 0.196, 'compound': 0.8979, 'neg': 0.0}
we noticed that the rooms by the larger pool were being upgraded and hope this will continue throughout the hotel because rooms are looking very tired. {'neu': 0.798, 'pos': 0.096, 'compound': -0.0754, 'neg': 0.106}

we e-mailed ahead of arrival on a thompson package deal, to ask for a room near to the rear of the property, and on checking- in this had been recorded, so we were pleased to be allocated room v11 overlooking the smaller pool. {'neu': 0.94, 'pos': 0.06, 'compound': 0.4877, 'neg': 0.0}
the rooms remain very basic with not enough drawer(one small one in the tv table and one small one inside the cupboard) or wardrobe space, and no bedside cabinet on one side of the bed, for glasses, books etc. {'neu': 0.945, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.296, 'neg': 0.055}
it was hard to keep the room tidy and know where anything was because of the lack of storage space, plus it was quite dark inside all the time needing the lights on, as the small balcony never saw the sun. {'neu': 0.913, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.4019, 'neg': 0.087}

only one small hand towel and two larger towels daily, when really you need two of each. {'neu': 0.833, 'pos': 0.167, 'compound': 0.4939, 'neg': 0.0}
you do get given pool towels or beach towels though each day, which was good. {'neu': 0.828, 'pos': 0.172, 'compound': 0.4404, 'neg': 0.0}

because we had stayed here before we knew what to expect, but were pleasantly surprised at the few improvements, though some first timers to goa changed rooms a few times before accepting that this is what you get, a no-frills hotel in a central location with a fairly good buffet breakfast each day and three meal vouchers to the value of rs/-850 per week, to use in the excellent restaurant. {'neu': 0.704, 'pos': 0.296, 'compound': 0.9773, 'neg': 0.0}

disclaimer : this is not a paid review and all comments are solely based on the reviewers personal experience... ;o)
the place is very good location is best ..on baga just opp to titos lane food- too good breakfast with great variety hospitality is also good... you can even get bikes from the employees at the hotel for a good price but all this at a very high price of the room
stayed at the ronil beach resort in july for 3 nights, got a great off-peak price including breakfast, the hotel itself inst too far from the beach as some have said, its about a leisurely 10min walk from baga beach, and a slow 30min stroll to calungate beach, you walk by a ton of shops & bars to reach either beach, so you don't really notice the distance if your popping in and out of the shops for a browse

the breakfast was good, as it was off peak there wasn't a buffet style breakfast, we were asked upon arrival at the restaurant what we would like, i always had scrambled egg on toast, again it was nice. {'neu': 0.85, 'pos': 0.15, 'compound': 0.9808, 'neg': 0.0}

they also have a small spa, you can have a 60min massage for rs1000, which was an added bonus, i didnt have one, but my friend did and said it was just as good as one you would get in london where they charge £60+ for 45min! {'neu': 0.793, 'pos': 0.207, 'compound': 0.8932, 'neg': 0.0}
the reception was very helpful in arranging car's and day trips for us, would highly recommend taking a car/taxi for the day and heading to the spice plantation, its about a 45min drive, so you need an ac car. {'neu': 0.856, 'pos': 0.144, 'compound': 0.7083, 'neg': 0.0}

visited goa again in march this year, 2012 - this time we stayed at the ronil beach hotel. {'neu': 0.862, 'pos': 0.138, 'compound': 0.8751, 'neg': 0.0}
the main reason for choosing this hotel was due to its location.- {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
first impressions were not very good - we were shown to a room, i think was 'c' block and it was awful. {'neu': 0.59, 'pos': 0.075, 'compound': -0.7665, 'neg': 0.335}
my daughter and i have never viewed a room in such bad condition and in need to repairs. {'neu': 0.811, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.5423, 'neg': 0.189}
the 'wardrobe' was made up of pieces of formica that were not even finished off! {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
there was a crack down the corner of a wall that you could have fitted a book into, and the overall state of the room was beyond poor. {'neu': 0.886, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.4767, 'neg': 0.114}
we went back to reception to request another room and were treated very badly. {'neu': 0.793, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.5256, 'neg': 0.207}
initially the man at reception was quite pleasant until we refused to move into the room then another man who intoduced himself as 'duty manager' spoke to us and was etremely rude and would not allow us to speak really. {'neu': 0.775, 'pos': 0.077, 'compound': -0.3123, 'neg': 0.148}
we eventually were moved to a more acceptable room.-------------- {'neu': 0.73, 'pos': 0.27, 'compound': 0.3804, 'neg': 0.0}
the hotel pools did not have filters and became very dirty with a scum always present along the surface. {'neu': 0.842, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.4927, 'neg': 0.158}
when the edges of the pool were cleaned, all the dirt was then washed into the pool as was the water used for cleaning the floors asround the pool - it was quite disgusting. {'neu': 0.836, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.7264, 'neg': 0.164}
on the plus side, the staff were wonderful and nothing was a problem - i strongly believe that the hotel only has returning guests because the staff keep the place going - the food is also very good

the ronil beach hotel needs urgent refurbishment - the owners should invest money into the place and then it may be a more acceptable place to stay - it is only popular because of its location!! {'neu': 0.762, 'pos': 0.215, 'compound': 0.9339, 'neg': 0.023}
anyone booking this hotel, must be very cautious of the rooms - some have been upgraded and others have not. {'neu': 0.914, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.1761, 'neg': 0.086}
i think returning guests must be given the best rooms.....

we were not the only first time visitors who they tried to fob off with sub standard rooms. {'neu': 0.861, 'pos': 0.139, 'compound': 0.6369, 'neg': 0.0}

last time we went to goa was 2 years ago and we went to cavillossim in the south, there is a huge difference between the two, baga is very lively with plenty of bars, restaurants and night clubs. {'neu': 0.861, 'pos': 0.139, 'compound': 0.6697, 'neg': 0.0}
we had a great holiday here, but if your planning a visit, go with an open mind. {'neu': 0.747, 'pos': 0.253, 'compound': 0.5267, 'neg': 0.0}
just got back from 2 weeks staying at the ronil,we had already stayed there before, the room we had was quite good by indias standard, very clean with clean sheets and towels every day,and free beach towels if you needed them, the food was good and plenty of it , the hotel staff are very freindly and really helpfull ,there was not many sunbeds but we never used them anyway so it didn't bother us the hotel also give you six vouchers to use for meals a handy thing if you cant be bothered to eat out ,the hotel is in a good spot and handy for everything baga has to offer,the only downside of our holiday was coco who works at xaviers beach shack hit a dog with a metal pole in for nothing and other cases of cruelty to the dogs on the beaches,there was also a lot of rubbish on the beach itself ,what a shame it could be lovely if they clean it up. {'neu': 0.765, 'pos': 0.172, 'compound': 0.9569, 'neg': 0.063}
we have just arrived back from a great stay at the ronil beach resort, upon arrival as it was early morning we were told to leave our things in reception and go and help ourselves to breakfast, breakfast is great! {'neu': 0.739, 'pos': 0.236, 'compound': 0.8999, 'neg': 0.025}
fresh tea, coffee and juices, bread(made at the hotel every evening) cornflakes, fruit, indian breakfast, bacon,sausage, beans and eggs in whatever shape or form you wish! {'neu': 0.819, 'pos': 0.181, 'compound': 0.6476, 'neg': 0.0}
we had to wait a while for our room, which the first one we were given we changed, i think you do have to try and over come the shock of goa and the basic accomodation if you haven't been before but we were quickly put into another room we were happier with. {'neu': 0.884, 'pos': 0.083, 'compound': 0.5859, 'neg': 0.032}
rooms cleaned daily with fresh bedding and towels every other day. {'neu': 0.813, 'pos': 0.187, 'compound': 0.3182, 'neg': 0.0}
it was however clear very quickly that many of the people staying in the hotel come back every year and pick the rooms they want which are all the good ones but this didnt really matter. {'neu': 0.835, 'pos': 0.128, 'compound': 0.3535, 'neg': 0.037}
i have to agree about the lack of sunbeds, i think in two weeks we only got sunbeds on our last day but this wont ruin your holiday as there are as many sunbeds as you want down at the great beach shacks. {'neu': 0.667, 'pos': 0.247, 'compound': 0.8563, 'neg': 0.086}
another great thing about the hotel is the location which is great and whilst the road is chaos outside the front, once you are through the reception the atmosphere round the pool is very relaxing! {'neu': 0.664, 'pos': 0.257, 'compound': 0.8513, 'neg': 0.079}
also we were given 6 x vouchers for 1000 rupees each to eat at the hotel, this is a great little extra and each one can easily pay for meals for two people, you can only use them one at a time and the hotel food is very good. {'neu': 0.787, 'pos': 0.186, 'compound': 0.8516, 'neg': 0.027}
goa is a really great holiday and very cheap these are my tips if you have never been.....

overall the ronil beach is a good hotel and the staff are very friendly and helpful, however there are insufficient sun loungers for the amount of people who use the hotel and this causes issues. {'neu': 0.766, 'pos': 0.234, 'compound': 0.8576, 'neg': 0.0}
the possessive behaviour i witnessed of the 3 english people who were in rooms v3 & v5 during the period 12th feb and still there on the 26th feb (and yes i am english myself) regarding the few sun beds and loungers that were available around the small pool was totally unacceptable. {'neu': 0.851, 'pos': 0.051, 'compound': -0.3597, 'neg': 0.098}
we had a ground floor room and were able to witness their behaviour on the daily basis and by 0600 hrs each day they had marked out their territory by laying out towels and books, however there would be long periods throughout the day and especialy first thing in the morning when they were not being used but other people where wandering around looking for a sun bed /lounger. {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
there was one day on the 25th when another holiday maker managed to secure these 3 sun beds and the response on the 26th was swift and paroqial and just epitimised why us english are looked upon as fools. {'neu': 0.771, 'pos': 0.156, 'compound': 0.4019, 'neg': 0.073}
the female victor meldrew of the party (we never saw her smile in two weeks) got up at 0440 hrs and put out towels, books and the wooden table signs which said reserved onto the 3 sun beds in order to ensure they secured "their" little bit of england. {'neu': 0.813, 'pos': 0.148, 'compound': 0.7087, 'neg': 0.039}

i believe these people stay at the hotel for up to 8 weeks and therefore believe they have a greater right to the use of the sun beds than other holiday makers so much so that i also believe the lady in question had the audacity to go and complain the the hotel manager that oher people had got "their" sun beds. {'neu': 0.877, 'pos': 0.083, 'compound': 0.4019, 'neg': 0.04}
if an i believe first choice & thompson are going to only do all inclusive holiday to this hotel next year then the lack of space and sun beds/loungers will create issues because rather than go down to the beach which is what people do at present more people will want to spend time around the pools and the facilities and behavioiurs of a small element will not allow this

hi
my wife and i stayed at the ronil beech 4th till 11th feb for 1 week.room no c4 ground level by pool but facing outwards so small balcony was not very appealing but this didn"t bother us as we never use it anyway.rooms cleaned daily with fresh towels and clean sheets, fan plus remote control a/c.breakfast was fine consisted of omlettes,eggs to order,toast machine fruit and a couple of spicy dishes plus tea & coffee served at your table no problems there also a great touch by the hotel was the three free 1000 rupee vouchers which each voucher would buy you a 2 course meal for 2 with sides.food is of a very high standard and you are able to enjoy a great meal whilst being entertained by various singers.the hotel also provides clean beech towels daily which you pick up at the security gate on the way out and drop them there on the way back.one downside was the pool which didn"t look very appealing and was hardly used think this may have been lack of some sort of filter/cleaning system as water just seemed to be stagnent.outside the hotel everything is right there from supermarket to chemist to cash machines right amongst the madness that is baga.we loved baga and this hotel and will be returning next year. {'neu': 0.732, 'pos': 0.18, 'compound': 0.9822, 'neg': 0.088}

we agree wholeheartedly with the previous writer. {'neu': 0.679, 'pos': 0.321, 'compound': 0.8402, 'neg': 0.0}
however our one complaint was that we were given e4 as our room on arrival. {'neu': 0.864, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.296, 'neg': 0.136}
it must the the worst room in the hotel on the front corner with all the noise from the road outside which meant we could not open windows or even curtains, nor sit on the balcony. {'neu': 0.895, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.6249, 'neg': 0.105}

eventually with the help of the jewel in the crown rep we were given a room in v block at the back but with no balcony for 1 night, and then were moved to v! {'neu': 0.764, 'pos': 0.098, 'compound': -0.3489, 'neg': 0.138}
a room on the ground floor overlooking the small pool with a balcony. {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}

we had booked our holiday with thomas cook and thought we were going bed and breakfast, however we were given 6 food vouchers, each worth 1,000 rupees to spend in the hotel restaurant. {'neu': 0.867, 'pos': 0.133, 'compound': 0.5574, 'neg': 0.0}
(when changing money the currency exchange rate was 78-76 rupees to the £1.00) the food in the restaurant was really good and reasonably priced for a hotel so a couple could eat quite well on a 1,000 rupee voucher. {'neu': 0.859, 'pos': 0.141, 'compound': 0.6794, 'neg': 0.0}

after such a long flight i felt that having to wait around for almost 4 hours was not really acceptable. {'neu': 0.88, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.2912, 'neg': 0.12}
the swimming pools were also not as clean as they could have been. {'neu': 0.842, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.3089, 'neg': 0.158}
there was visible scum and debris floating on top of the pool, and a number of people stopped going in because of this. {'neu': 0.792, 'pos': 0.129, 'compound': 0.0516, 'neg': 0.079}
the pool attendant did go round the pool with a fishing net on a stick a couple of times a day to try to skim off the debris but it never appeared to be really clean. {'neu': 0.886, 'pos': 0.114, 'compound': 0.611, 'neg': 0.0}
the road outside the hotel got so busy, especially at weekends, that it was really hard to cross the road safely. {'neu': 0.795, 'pos': 0.134, 'compound': 0.3626, 'neg': 0.071}
although cars would be bumper to bumper going nowhere due to the volume of traffic, motorbikes and scooters would be weaving in and out and even driving on the wrong side of the road to try to sneak through. {'neu': 0.925, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.4767, 'neg': 0.075}
everyone would be honking their car/bike/scooter horns and it started to wear you down after a while. {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
in the two weeks we were there we saw two very bad accidents just outside the hotel, not something you want to see on holiday. {'neu': 0.671, 'pos': 0.086, 'compound': -0.5985, 'neg': 0.243}
the hotel is located on the corner of baga road and titos road so tito's nightclub and lots of other bars are literally on the doorstep. {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
we were initially allocated a room in d block at the front of the hotel but asked to be moved after one night as we wanted a balcony not a terrace, and the noise from the traffic was quite loud. {'neu': 0.947, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.2382, 'neg': 0.053}
we were moved to a room in v block at the back of the hotel with a good sized balcony. {'neu': 0.721, 'pos': 0.139, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.139}
once the balcony doors were closed we did not hear the traffic at all. {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
in fact it was so peaceful in v block that we had a view over the river and you could sit on your balcony and see eagles flying around. {'neu': 0.774, 'pos': 0.128, 'compound': 0.2388, 'neg': 0.098}
all in all i feel ronil is a good hotel but i will probably stay in calangute/candolim next time due to the traffic situation in baga. {'neu': 0.919, 'pos': 0.081, 'compound': 0.2382, 'neg': 0.0}
i have visted ronil after a gap of 10 yrs, unfortunately it is not the same as before firstly as many other hotles have come up around the same area and with better ammenties. {'neu': 0.85, 'pos': 0.082, 'compound': 0.128, 'neg': 0.068}
its not worth for what you paying for ammeneties in the highest category rooms is limited. {'neu': 0.797, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.3749, 'neg': 0.203}
the only pluspoint is for its location

my wiife and i stopped at the ronil over the xmas period.all we can say is thankyou to the management and staff for a wonderful stay and xmas,arriving at the ronil you wonder where have we come to,on entering the hotel it all changes with a warm welcome,we were shown to our room,we found it very roomy,with furniture that was dated,the decor needed a bit of a touch up to the paintwork,but apart from that it was clean,with ample towels and clean sheets,in the uk this would have taken their 3 star rating to a one star,but with the cleanliness of the rooms,and change of towels and sheets daily,and service and welcome we received,it certainly earned its 3 stars plus.the pool areas were kept clean,the hotel supplied,poolside towels daily on demand,also beach towels on the same basis.going out of the hotel,you realise that you are in the center of baga,we found it to be different to what we saw on arrival,vibrant and exciting,a feeling we never lost for the 2 weeks we stayed there,near to the beach,and the main thing we found it was safe to walk around at any time of day or night.we booked bed and breakfast,but on arrival the hotel gave us 6 vouchers to the value of 1000 rupees for six free meals at the hotel,just for food you pay for your drinks.there are no tea making facilities in the room,but room service was available.the decorations the hotel put up were very attractive,and the tables and final decor for xmas day did us all proud,as did the free meal and entertainment the hotel provided,it was a very special christmas.just a few tips,in the uk you pay between £4-£10 for mosquito spray,in goa you pay 53rupees,bear in mind there are 80 rupees to the pound,about.also if you have an unlocked phone take it to a phone shop,i used the one next to the state bank in clangute,along with a passport photo,and your passport,and purchase an airtel sim card,you will pay pennies for your calls back to the uk,slightly more to mobiles,but only slightly.all in all we had an excellent stay at the ronil,with absolutely no complaints,thanks to the staff and management,and would recommend it to anyone,your in india,the blemishes are few,and dont let them spoil your holiday,enjoy. {'neu': 0.867, 'pos': 0.103, 'compound': 0.9837, 'neg': 0.03}

the room and bahroms were very un hygienic.---------------------- {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
i immediately went down to reception and asked for the manager named austin. {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
we informed him that we wished to find alternate accomodation for reasons stated above and requested a refund. {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
he did not listen to our complaints or even bother to try and accommodate us a family of four including two children, his reply was simply that a no refund policy was upheld despite me not being informed. {'neu': 0.819, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.743, 'neg': 0.181}
he replied saying that i the customer did not ask about the cancellation policy whilst communicating directly with him via email. {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
i did not inquire but srongly believe tha nor did he or the website disclose any cancellation policy which as a now still does not contain any reference to same. {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
i am totally disgusted with this hotel and the poor sevice we received especially the unwillingness to come to some compromise. {'neu': 0.726, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.7778, 'neg': 0.274}
to top it off austin asked me to pay 100 rupees for wifi access so tha i could find alternate accomodation, this after paying 40000 rupees on advance. {'neu': 0.887, 'pos': 0.064, 'compound': 0.1027, 'neg': 0.05}

here is an unbiased review of the hotel:

location: unbeatable.-- {'neu': 0.891, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.0258, 'neg': 0.109}
located on the baga – calangute road, very close to the beach (5 mn walk, about 300 mts) and roughly in the center of these 2 ends (baga, calangute), tending to be closer to baga rather than calangute end which is a good thing. {'neu': 0.932, 'pos': 0.068, 'compound': 0.4404, 'neg': 0.0}

breakfast gets quite dull after a week and cleanliness cd improve but all in all it was a good choice and would happily stay there again
we had selected ronil's due to proximity to baga beach... {'neu': 0.703, 'pos': 0.251, 'compound': 0.8659, 'neg': 0.047}
the rooms are nice are book rooms in the villas at the front side of the property as the room on the back side are not too great.... {'neu': 0.906, 'pos': 0.094, 'compound': 0.4215, 'neg': 0.0}
they have a decent breakfast and it is walking distance to all the good eating places, shopping places and most importantly baga beach...
have been to india many times and each time return home wanting more! {'neu': 0.851, 'pos': 0.149, 'compound': 0.6989, 'neg': 0.0}
in my experience ronil beach is a basic 3 star hotel in the middle of action packed baga. {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
ideally situated for baga, shops, beach and the many eating places, a quick taxi ride will take you to calangute, candolim or further a field to the old hippy hang out of arambol. {'neu': 0.915, 'pos': 0.085, 'compound': 0.4215, 'neg': 0.0}

staff on the whole were friendly, reception staff tended to adopt a professional stance until you had met them a few times and then as friendly and smiling as the rest of the staff. {'neu': 0.716, 'pos': 0.284, 'compound': 0.8779, 'neg': 0.0}
pools seemed to have plenty of sun beds and didnt seem overcrowded. {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
the only suggestion i would make for real improvement would be the bathrooms need some tlc, quite dirty, well used and soiled. {'neu': 0.677, 'pos': 0.202, 'compound': 0.2927, 'neg': 0.12}
other than this a great hotel on par with several other 3 star places in north goa and better than others. {'neu': 0.686, 'pos': 0.314, 'compound': 0.8305, 'neg': 0.0}
pathetic service, pathetic staff....trust me, you wanna stay here at your own risk. {'neu': 0.513, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.8591, 'neg': 0.487}
we booked a three day package and checked out after the first day forfeiting our entire money. {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
there are many better hotels in and around baga which will cost you the same and much better service and staff. {'neu': 0.766, 'pos': 0.234, 'compound': 0.7003, 'neg': 0.0}
all i want to say is that stay here at your own risk.------------ {'neu': 0.746, 'pos': 0.097, 'compound': -0.2023, 'neg': 0.157}

this hotel has some very clear pros & cons

let's start with pros -
1. excellent location. {'neu': 0.664, 'pos': 0.336, 'compound': 0.7645, 'neg': 0.0}
it's right in the heart of baga.--------------------------------- {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
tito's, mambo's, the baga beach shacks... everything is barely a 200m walk. {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
the renowned britto's cafe is just down the road... about 1 km from the resort. {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
other places in north goa... fort aguada, anjuna/ vagator beach etc. {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
are all located within 20-25 mins distance (on bike)
2. very good facilities in the hotel... although you won't be using them if you are staying that close to baga. {'neu': 0.901, 'pos': 0.099, 'compound': 0.4927, 'neg': 0.0}
the resort has a couple of nice & clean pools, a snooker/pool table. {'neu': 0.593, 'pos': 0.407, 'compound': 0.6705, 'neg': 0.0}

3. rooms are quite big and spacious
4. they are quite flexible as they didn't charge me for an early check-in; i checked-in as early as 7am while regular check-in time is 1pm. {'neu': 0.934, 'pos': 0.066, 'compound': 0.2944, 'neg': 0.0}
5. you can get bikes and cabs right outside the hotel gate.------ {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
not just one or two providers... there are hordes of them so you can bargain with multiple of them and choose the bike you want. {'neu': 0.872, 'pos': 0.128, 'compound': 0.3321, 'neg': 0.0}
the hotel also has a decent sized parking space so you don't have to worry about parking the rented bike. {'neu': 0.882, 'pos': 0.118, 'compound': 0.3412, 'neg': 0.0}
the negatives of this resort, apart from a few, won't really matter as once in baga, you won't feel like spending much time in the hotel. {'neu': 0.871, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.3401, 'neg': 0.129}
here are somethings i didn't like -
1. bedsheets weren't what you call squeeky clean whites. {'neu': 0.714, 'pos': 0.161, 'compound': 0.1506, 'neg': 0.126}
i could spot a couple of brown marks.---------------------------- {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
also the mattresses weren't the best
2. the person answering your calls for reservation queries isn't quite pleasing. {'neu': 0.716, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.7477, 'neg': 0.284}
but don't let that affect your decision towards or against this hotel
3. they don't provide airport pick-up & drop... but that hardly matters as cabs are available right outside the hotel. {'neu': 0.959, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.0745, 'neg': 0.041}
the receptionist also arranges for your cab.--------------------- {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
4. the staff isn't very pleasing.-------------------------------- {'neu': 0.626, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.4575, 'neg': 0.374}

ask for mineral water.------------------------------------------- {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
best - buy a bottle of mineral water from outside.--------------- {'neu': 0.625, 'pos': 0.375, 'compound': 0.6369, 'neg': 0.0}
there is a general store right outside the gates
5. there is a significant difference in the size & location of the rooms. {'neu': 0.913, 'pos': 0.087, 'compound': 0.2023, 'neg': 0.0}
the best located rooms (standard deluxe) are the ones with a view of the pool. {'neu': 0.756, 'pos': 0.244, 'compound': 0.6369, 'neg': 0.0}
and the worst are the ones facing the road, which can be noisy at times. {'neu': 0.691, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.7003, 'neg': 0.309}
insist for a pool facing room right at the time of booking.------ {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
you won't get those rooms at the last moment.-------------------- {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
also, be careful, some of the rooms (including the one i stayed in) have a garbage heap outside your balcony. {'neu': 0.914, 'pos': 0.086, 'compound': 0.1531, 'neg': 0.0}
although there was no stink from there... but it didn't provide the best view from balcony. {'neu': 0.619, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.7907, 'neg': 0.381}
overall, i'll highly recommend this hotel if you want to enjoy and explore goa. {'neu': 0.601, 'pos': 0.399, 'compound': 0.7425, 'neg': 0.0}

the ronil resort is an aging property with outdated small rooms, worn out equipment and dirty bathrooms. {'neu': 0.746, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.6249, 'neg': 0.254}
there is no tea/coffee maker in the room and you are not provided any complimentary bottles of mineral water. {'neu': 0.787, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.5583, 'neg': 0.213}
the fittings, fixtures, matresses and the bathrooms do not seem to have received any refurbishment or renovation for years.the air conditioners rattle, the white phones have yellowed with age, cable quality on old style televisions is extremely poor, the remotes for the tv and ac are greasy and falling apart. {'neu': 0.906, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.6115, 'neg': 0.094}
the beds, cabinets and the single chair in the room are of such shoddy quality that it is hard to beleive that a resort would have such furniture. {'neu': 0.949, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.1027, 'neg': 0.051}
the consistency of the breakfast spread is 100 % i.e everyday it is the same fare so you can have the same puri/chana or omellete toast during the entire length of your stay. {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
it also needs to be added that the breakfast is dumped on the tables in an unaesthetic manner much like a chore that needs to be done and got over with. {'neu': 0.843, 'pos': 0.075, 'compound': -0.0516, 'neg': 0.081}

the sofas in the lobby have all sorts of stains and the cushions sag. {'neu': 0.922, 'pos': 0.078, 'compound': 0.0258, 'neg': 0.0}
they have an extremely slow wi-fi service which is available only in the lobby ( yes to use it you have to sit on the sagging stained cushions and no it is not free)to sum up - the ronil resort is in an advanced state of decay. {'neu': 0.789, 'pos': 0.114, 'compound': -0.0258, 'neg': 0.097}
do not be misled by the fact that the pool appears pristine or that the exterior looks very white in the pictures. {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
i booked this resort based on the reviews which i read on tripadvisor which showed the resort in a very positive light but the actual scenario is completely different. {'neu': 0.911, 'pos': 0.089, 'compound': 0.3499, 'neg': 0.0}

another point that i would like to mention is that normally travel portals are given the best rates by hotels/resorts but in the case of the ronil this is not so. {'neu': 0.866, 'pos': 0.134, 'compound': 0.5187, 'neg': 0.0}
they are open to negotiation with the walk in customers and chop off huge amounts from their rack rates with those who haggle. {'neu': 0.905, 'pos': 0.095, 'compound': 0.3182, 'neg': 0.0}
the distinctive feature which keeps this resort going is it's location. {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
it is in the nucleus of goa and bang in the middle of goa's tourist central i.e the calangute-baga road. {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
so though it may be walking distance from tito's, cape town or the beach it is still not worthwhile for even a mildly discerning traveller. {'neu': 0.919, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.2584, 'neg': 0.081}
in fact bear in mind that it's locational advantage is overly touted and location does not mean that you can get away with baby cockroaches in the bathrooms. {'neu': 0.89, 'pos': 0.068, 'compound': 0.2023, 'neg': 0.041}

if you want to do an excursion, i would advise you to find one you want to do first and then ask a taxi driver outside the hotel for a price as it will be a lot cheaper than any of the tour companies. {'neu': 0.936, 'pos': 0.064, 'compound': 0.1531, 'neg': 0.0}

the taxi driver will take you to the destination, wait for you – which is sometimes all day – and then bring you back again; all for a ridiculously cheap price. {'neu': 0.918, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.34, 'neg': 0.082}

if you want to escape the hustle and bustle of baga and calangute, i would recommend mandrem beach. {'neu': 0.718, 'pos': 0.282, 'compound': 0.5423, 'neg': 0.0}
there was only 1 beach shack in the immediate area and the beach was pretty much empty. {'neu': 0.737, 'pos': 0.168, 'compound': 0.34, 'neg': 0.095}

must admit really wasn't looking forward to this holiday but hey how wrong could i be.the ronil beach is in a superb location and for that reason we are looking to re-book for next year.the bedrooms are basic and the bathrooms leave a lot to be desired but the service we received from room boys to waiters, was first rate.do not go to this area if you want a deserted beach area.we absolutely loved the hustle and bustle.the beach shacks where you can find something different everyday and night were brilliant.we stayed in f block which overlooked the pool but is in the older part of the hotel.friends of ours stayed in v block and their room was newer looking.the laundry service is excellant and next time we will take less luggage and make more use of this service.we never had a bad meal at the ronil and used all of our vouchers.the down side for us was the main pool area which is desperate need of a face lift as was the breakfast area.but on saying this for the money we paid we were delighted.their are so many places to eat which are really really cheap.we loved kim faa chinese and east meets west .had brill food at the beach shacks and what more can you ask for sat on the beach watching the sea and all the entertainment fom firework displays to performing tight rope walkers.loved it and can't wait for next year. {'neu': 0.818, 'pos': 0.119, 'compound': 0.9518, 'neg': 0.064}

hi

just recently returned from goa inida (baga resort). {'neu': 0.748, 'pos': 0.103, 'compound': -0.1901, 'neg': 0.15}
just thought i would let people know, i would not really recommend this hotel ronil beach resort its cleanliness left a lot to be desired... the staff were miserable, not a bit friendly, yeah the odd one was nice... but only the odd one. {'neu': 0.745, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.8235, 'neg': 0.255}
when you arrive there you get free meal vouchers to eat in the restaurant in the hotel.... rip off!!! {'neu': 0.812, 'pos': 0.188, 'compound': 0.6341, 'neg': 0.0}
you get charged tax on your whole bill if you order alcoholic drinks.... the meals were nice though that has to be said, but be cautious as a few of the waiters didnt bring back change for a purchase and tend to have different prices for items keep an eye on it. {'neu': 0.913, 'pos': 0.037, 'compound': 0.0772, 'neg': 0.05}
when we was vacating our room there was a cleaner early hours in the morning sniffing around the room waiting to get in to get the tips out of the room very sly i thought as this was not the regular cleaner.... the bathroom was filthy and although well stocked with toilet rolls etc, the sink needed a good wash. {'neu': 0.89, 'pos': 0.11, 'compound': 0.6908, 'neg': 0.0}
the first room we got put in smelt damp and dirty, they did move us but we had to wait for a bit..... be warned the beds are like concrete they are the most uncomfortable beds i have ever slept in abroad and i have stayed in many places there was a lot of painting going on and refurbishment some of our party didnt get much peace, the pool had quite a lot of dead insects in, could of been cleaned a bit more. {'neu': 0.737, 'pos': 0.071, 'compound': -0.9146, 'neg': 0.193}
if you decide to go to goa, dont stay in baga its just a nightmare too busy and noisy!! {'neu': 0.882, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.3147, 'neg': 0.118}
i have been to goa twice and the nicest resort i think is candolim and they are not far away from each other in a cab anyway so best staying in quiet area and travelling around quite cheap!! {'neu': 0.783, 'pos': 0.217, 'compound': 0.8793, 'neg': 0.0}
when i stayed in candolim i stayed in the highland beach resort and that hotel and the staff is excellent, although some of the accommodation there is iffy, ours wasent but another person we spoke to was, their accommodation is very spacious and i would highly recommend. {'neu': 0.874, 'pos': 0.126, 'compound': 0.7218, 'neg': 0.0}
there is a nice beach to go to for peace and quiet its near mojim i cant remember the name but the taxi drivers know if you just say the beach near mojim the quiet one very quiet not many sellers, paradise!!!. {'neu': 0.883, 'pos': 0.117, 'compound': 0.6157, 'neg': 0.0}
some good restaurants inferno in candolim have excellent food and service its a little bit more expensive but well worth it, another is east meets west ,again bit more expensive but again worth it, there is entertainment here too, lovely setting. {'neu': 0.612, 'pos': 0.388, 'compound': 0.9635, 'neg': 0.0}
a must do trip is the plantation, any taxi will take you there dont pay any more than 600 - 700 rupees return trip they wait for you and its 300 rupees per person in, that includes lunch its a real interesting trip you can do the elephant trip on the same visit its on the way, should not cost you any more in a cab.... use the tuc tucs for travelling they are half the price of a taxi or even cheaper the bus you can get a bus most places for about 10 rupees so cheap and a good experience

let me offer my opinion of baga and ronil beach resort.---------- {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
we like others were hit by the culture change when we stepped off the coach but i'm glad to say that within hours we were acclimatised and loving every second. {'neu': 0.709, 'pos': 0.291, 'compound': 0.9022, 'neg': 0.0}
the ronil staff handed us the keys to the much dreaded v block - v32 to be precise. {'neu': 0.68, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.765, 'neg': 0.32}
let me clear this up now.---------------------------------------- {'neu': 0.658, 'pos': 0.342, 'compound': 0.3818, 'neg': 0.0}
if you are offered v31 - v33 then snap it up!-------------------- {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
these rooms are on the top deck of v block, are fully refurbished, do not smell in any way shape or form, are bigger than 90% of other rooms at ronil and more importantly are superbly quiet on an evening. {'neu': 0.832, 'pos': 0.101, 'compound': 0.1263, 'neg': 0.067}
our friends had road side rooms which when combined with our goan friends penchant for honking horns every other second, made for a few restless nights. {'neu': 0.726, 'pos': 0.205, 'compound': 0.6249, 'neg': 0.069}
the staff at ronil are wonderfully friendly, especially the security guards who took great amounts of pleasure in standing to attention and saluting me, before shaking my hand, every single time i strolled past. {'neu': 0.536, 'pos': 0.429, 'compound': 0.9642, 'neg': 0.035}
to those that complain about unfriendlyness, did you make an effort? {'neu': 0.8, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.3612, 'neg': 0.2}
we went out of our way to say hello and introduce ourselves to all the staff and as a result we were greeted with genuine and heart felt warmth whenever we crossed paths. {'neu': 0.855, 'pos': 0.145, 'compound': 0.6249, 'neg': 0.0}
the pool area is a true little oasis from the organised madness outside, the pool cleaners were both lovely and efficient at de-bugging the water regularly and although it feels hotter by the pool, the lack of sand made it our choice of sunbathing spot for a couple of days. {'neu': 0.747, 'pos': 0.163, 'compound': 0.6369, 'neg': 0.09}
i would really recommend that you eat outside the hotel to avoid service tax and vat. {'neu': 0.723, 'pos': 0.155, 'compound': 0.1513, 'neg': 0.122}
the food is edible at ronil but with such an amazing wealth of quality and cheap restaurants in baga and calungute, why not just take a walk or taxi instead? {'neu': 0.74, 'pos': 0.26, 'compound': 0.8885, 'neg': 0.0}
we loved east meets west and electric cats (calungute, not the one opposite the hotel). {'neu': 0.782, 'pos': 0.218, 'compound': 0.5994, 'neg': 0.0}
baga beach is something else too, we made immediate friends with a shack owner and spent many days just chilling out, having a laugh with the beach sellers (there like london buses so get ready) and being ritually pounded by the massive but refreshing waves crashing the shoreline every 20 seconds. {'neu': 0.863, 'pos': 0.117, 'compound': 0.6187, 'neg': 0.02}
if you have young children, be advised that at this time of year the waves are very powerful and i was saddened to learn that two middle -aged people perished at the hands of the baga beach waves whilst we were on holiday. {'neu': 0.809, 'pos': 0.12, 'compound': 0.3384, 'neg': 0.071}
you might be better seeking a beach elsewhere along the coast, don't worry as you will have plenty to choose from. {'neu': 0.772, 'pos': 0.228, 'compound': 0.6492, 'neg': 0.0}
i could ramble on forever about all the cool people we met and the places we visited but it's more fun for you to go outside and find it for yourself! {'neu': 0.804, 'pos': 0.196, 'compound': 0.7803, 'neg': 0.0}

hi we are just back on the 22 feb i think i read every review on this site before leavingso i thought i would tell you about our trip.we travelled with first choice and paid for premium seats we were on the first flight from east midlands to be honest i dont think the seats were much wider the meal was served with possibly nicer crockery and your cases were the first on off which was good for the journey home.we paid £300pounds each so dont think will do it again.having read so much about the airport i did not find it that bad although it was early morning also was very suprissed by the coach it was fine and we had a pleasent drive to the hotel our rep was gary and he was very good gave us loads off info during the holiday and always checked we were ok when he saw us.we arrined at hotel and as expected our rooms were not ready we were told to have breakfast and they would allocatr our rooms soon after.wewent to the breakfast area and had a great choice much more than i had imagined there was even porridge.i found the breakfast area to be clean thoughout our stay and the waiters were always on hand with fresh tea and coffee. {'neu': 0.845, 'pos': 0.132, 'compound': 0.9732, 'neg': 0.024}
there were 4 in our group and we all had our rooms by 11 we were travelling as 1 couple and 2 singles we had two rooms in v block when they told us this i was very dissapointed but when we got to our rooms i was happy with them although storage was a bit tight.on looking at the bed the mattress was a bit thin also toilet seat was broken i reported this and also requsted exrra mattresses and pillows this was done within the hour so i have no complaints we also during our stay have aproblem with the air con but again this was fixed.our room was cleaned every day with clean sheets and towels we also had towel art one day there was also a lift in this block which was very usefull for my mum who has difficulty with stairs the only thing was people kepted leaving the inside door open which meant the lift would not opperate we were always with my mum so my husband would have to run up the stairs and close the door ok for my mum but if someone was on there own they would have been unable to use the lift.the other member of our party was in i block again really nice seemed a larger room also had a fridge. {'neu': 0.821, 'pos': 0.079, 'compound': -0.609, 'neg': 0.1}
there was a nice smaller pool outside our block and a loverly grassed area with loungeres and umberella the groundes were kept immaculate and all the staff were very friendly from the gardeners up to the owner .the large pool was lovely and we did not find it dirty there was always pool towels with no restrictions on how many you took you could even take them to the beach they were definatly not shabby looking and i also found the sheets and room towels to be really white too.there were sunbeds around the pool and tale and chairs some with umberellas my only negative would be that there was not enough shades for me that said thats just me alot of the time people seemed to go out in the day returning late afternoon so shade was not a great issue at these times.if you did decide to sit around the pool all day you did not have to move as the waiters were great the food at the hotel was really good with a daily special board which repeated weekly so if you missed it on the first week you had the chance to catch it again.we had vouchers and used them and this made a very cheap night.the main bar closed at eleven but the pool room bar opened till later but this bar did not open till 7 so you could not play pool until then.the location of the hotel is fantastic and we loved baga you dont even notice the noise after the first day .i would consider myself to be a little vary about walking about abroad straight away i felt comfortable and at no time during our stay felt unsafe in any wayeven in taxis maybe we were lucky but all our drivers seemed good drivers.we tried loads of restraunts all meantioned in previeous reviews east meets west lovely setting i had steak and was not that impressed my husband had curry and he loved it. {'neu': 0.807, 'pos': 0.137, 'compound': 0.9863, 'neg': 0.056}

we went to the delhi darbar in panjim lots of nice little touches took photo put it in a frame rose for ladies complimentry dishes also had a buy 2 kingfishers get one free bill only came to £14 taxi waited for us charged us 400 ruppees.we enjoyed indian spice the best and that was just down the road left out of hotelhad a great meal with drinks for £12 but i had a king prawn curry which was the most expensive dish on the menu so could have been much cheaper.my favourite restraunt by far was le jardin got a flyer from beach they asked if it was a special occassion i told them it was our wedding anniversary when we arrived the table was all decorated with rose petals and streamers the meal was fantastic very up market i again had fillet steak and it was perfect there was 4 of us we all had 3 courses drinks coffee and brandy and the bill came to £60 with tip they also fetched us a cake and all the waiters sang happy anniversary it was a great night forot to say i think the restraunt was in callangute.we did go to the beach most days and the food at the beach shacks was always really good for the 4 of us fom 10 till 3 with tip the bill came to about 1500 ruppees sometimes 2000 ruppees but we are all big eaters and that included beers and some shorts with mixers.we did a couple of trips but used taxis instead of through rep we really enyoyed them.we have been to a lot of places many a lot more plush than the ronil but i can honestly say this has got to be one of the best holidays i have been on i would have no hesitation in recommending the ronil to anyone i have already booked our return to goa next year we are going to try the south this time only because i want to experience both sides we have booked the dona sylvia after seeing lots of favourable reports on this webb site it is all inclusive but we will be going out and sampling the many bars and restrauntes im sure. {'neu': 0.841, 'pos': 0.141, 'compound': 0.9943, 'neg': 0.017}

husband and daughter, as other family members had their own views on the resort, hotel and holiday as a whole. {'neu': 0.87, 'pos': 0.13, 'compound': 0.4019, 'neg': 0.0}
ronil beach hotel: for a 3 star hotel we had no complaints whatsoever. {'neu': 0.647, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.5994, 'neg': 0.353}
we arrived around 8.30 am in the morning and had to wait for our rooms, but with it being breakfast time we could grab something to eat and drink. {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
our room was very basic, but exceptionally clean with a huge bed and air-conditioning. {'neu': 0.6, 'pos': 0.4, 'compound': 0.8092, 'neg': 0.0}
the bathroom was a little dated, but was spotless and we always had hot water throughout our stay. {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
the towels and bedding were changed everyday.-------------------- {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
there was also a small fridge in the room, together with a tv with satellite channels. {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
during the holiday there were power cuts almost everyday – but these were very short, and more like dips in power (i think the hotel must have had a back-up generator). {'neu': 0.785, 'pos': 0.167, 'compound': 0.6046, 'neg': 0.048}
the breakfast was buffet style with both indian and the usual british breakfast foods, ie. {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
omelettes cooked to request, cereals, toast, fresh fruit, tea/coffee and we had no complaints. {'neu': 0.604, 'pos': 0.126, 'compound': -0.3818, 'neg': 0.269}
we were issued with vouchers for our christmas/new year gala dinners and also a further 6 vouchers for 6 lunch/dinners for the duration of the 2 weeks stay. {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
the hotel put in great effort for the two gala dinners and the food, which was buffet style, was great with lots of choice. {'neu': 0.728, 'pos': 0.272, 'compound': 0.8481, 'neg': 0.0}
we didn’t manage to use all of the vouchers we were allocated, but on the two occasions we did use them the choice on the menu and the quality of food was excellent and you would be hard pushed to use the full value of each voucher (i think it was 750 rupees per room voucher for dinner and 350 rupees per lunch voucher). {'neu': 0.862, 'pos': 0.115, 'compound': 0.8201, 'neg': 0.023}
the ronil has two swimming pools, but both are quite small and not the sort you would ideally spend the day around – and a lot of the time they were in the shade – which was great for when you returned from the beach from having already had a lot of sun and just wanted a quick shower, swim and a cold beer. {'neu': 0.857, 'pos': 0.143, 'compound': 0.8847, 'neg': 0.0}
laundry service – absolutely fabulous, soooo cheap and managed to get all the clothes cleaned before returning home for around £10! {'neu': 0.827, 'pos': 0.173, 'compound': 0.6105, 'neg': 0.0}
hotel location: my only complaint was the really busy main road that runs outside the hotel. {'neu': 0.872, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.296, 'neg': 0.128}
with it being christmas/new year there was even more traffic and how we actually managed to get home in one piece was a miracle – but more on this later in my review. {'neu': 0.926, 'pos': 0.074, 'compound': 0.34, 'neg': 0.0}
overall, i would definitely recommend the hotel – but would suggest to anyone not to visit over the christmas/new year period due to sheer volume of folk that come down to baga from other parts of india. {'neu': 0.902, 'pos': 0.098, 'compound': 0.3818, 'neg': 0.0}
tip: if you are wanting a taxi go outside the hotel and walk a little – don’t let the guy who’s inside the hotel gates get one for you as it will cost you a little more. {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
over a 2 week period the difference will add up.----------------- {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
overall comments: the biggest issue for us as a family was the number of indians who ‘invaded’ baga for the christmas/new year period. {'neu': 0.942, 'pos': 0.058, 'compound': 0.0772, 'neg': 0.0}
they were all men and in groups.--------------------------------- {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
our daughter is 15 and blonde – it was very uncomfortable for her with the amount of staring and attention she attracted through no fault of her own. {'neu': 0.685, 'pos': 0.083, 'compound': -0.6115, 'neg': 0.232}
the groups were in no way threatening, but even going in/out of the sea my husband and i had to go with her due to groups either taking photos on their mobile phone or using cameras. {'neu': 0.897, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.4215, 'neg': 0.103}
this cultural difference was the biggest shock for us, but again, believe this to be the time of the year we visited, i don’t think it would have been so bad outside this time. {'neu': 0.794, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.8417, 'neg': 0.206}

it was manic.---------------------------------------------------- {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
there were so many taxis and motorcycles and with there being no pavement just walking from outside the hotel and to a restaurant/bar and getting there in one piece was a huge challenge. {'neu': 0.828, 'pos': 0.107, 'compound': 0.1027, 'neg': 0.065}
on top of this, you were continually asked if you wanted a taxi and again my daughter was exposed to comments and looks from men. {'neu': 0.876, 'pos': 0.072, 'compound': 0.128, 'neg': 0.052}

the beach was okay, but not as clean as i would have hoped and i don’t think it was raked during the 2 weeks we were there (yes, i know we were in india and not the caribbean, but for me this was disappointing). {'neu': 0.827, 'pos': 0.108, 'compound': 0.2413, 'neg': 0.065}

what was also good was that the owner would move on any sellers that would stop by your sunbed – they all seemed to know that the owner was keen to distract them and would just walk by. {'neu': 0.771, 'pos': 0.126, 'compound': 0.25, 'neg': 0.103}
however, if you did want to purchase anything from them, you simply moved off your sunbed and did your bartering a few feet away. {'neu': 0.944, 'pos': 0.056, 'compound': 0.0772, 'neg': 0.0}
highlight of the day were the cows and bulls which would invade the beach and lie in the shade – never seen or experienced this before! {'neu': 0.899, 'pos': 0.101, 'compound': 0.4003, 'neg': 0.0}
they were so tame.----------------------------------------------- {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
the trip back to the hotel each day would also have us overtaking an elephant or two on the road, a few cows and goats – again, something cultural i’ve not experienced before. {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}

the room was cleaned every day as well as new bed linen and clean towels and all the staff could not do enough for you. {'neu': 0.827, 'pos': 0.173, 'compound': 0.5859, 'neg': 0.0}

the only thing we found was there not enough sun loungers for the amount of people so we headed down to the beach most days (only 200 yds away)
we had heard about the beach shaks but didn't expect them to be anything like they was they are out of this world the staff can't do enough for you (ashok & chrishna) at the lucky star it also has fantastic food. {'neu': 0.85, 'pos': 0.15, 'compound': 0.9161, 'neg': 0.0}
we would also recomend the tigers & tuskers 3 day trip its alot of traveling but well worth it also book it localy its far much cheeper (day dripper tours)
overall we had a brilliant time and looking forward to returning in 2007
just returned from a two week stay at the ronil in baga and after listening to fellow tourists, i am convinced that it is the best hotel of this calibre in the resort centre. {'neu': 0.774, 'pos': 0.226, 'compound': 0.9664, 'neg': 0.0}
we were allocated a room in v block, which smelt a little damp on arrival, although with airing and air con, this was not really noticeable after a couple of days. {'neu': 0.9, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.4404, 'neg': 0.1}

rooms were cleaned on a daily basis and fresh towels were provided daily. {'neu': 0.827, 'pos': 0.173, 'compound': 0.3182, 'neg': 0.0}
soap and toilet tissue were replaced when needed.---------------- {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
it was a little noisy at times when the pool was in use and it is true that the number of sunbeds is insufficient....you need to be an early riser to secure one. {'neu': 0.78, 'pos': 0.181, 'compound': 0.624, 'neg': 0.039}
however, the beach is only 2 mins walk away and for very little money, a local taxi driver will take you to one of the many beaches (coco beach was lovely especially if you like a dip in the sea). {'neu': 0.842, 'pos': 0.158, 'compound': 0.7624, 'neg': 0.0}
the staff could not be faulted...... helpful, friendly, welcoming, honest and the service received was excellent....you are in goa and things are a little laid back....theres no real sense of urgency wherever you go (try an internal flight if you don't believe me!!). {'neu': 0.722, 'pos': 0.195, 'compound': 0.7728, 'neg': 0.083}
we asked them about beaches, jewellers, opticians etc and they always recommended good, cheap places - no complaints. {'neu': 0.575, 'pos': 0.208, 'compound': -0.0516, 'neg': 0.217}
the food was generally good especially the stuffed nan breads and i think there was only one meal which was not to our liking....cheap and cheerful with nightly entertainment (of a fashion haha)

loved the hotel, the staff and the location and we would definitely return

we were expecting a real 3 * property after having stayed at other 3* hotels in thailand and what we saw shocked us. {'neu': 0.892, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.3182, 'neg': 0.108}
the rooms were quite cramped and the bathrooms were the asian style. {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}

the shower and loo are only separated by a shower curtain.------- {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
this in essence means that you have to get you feet wet when using the toilet especially after one of you has had a shower. {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
i was later made to understand that this was a luxury as most other properties would not even have a shower curtain so the loo would be sprayed with water when one is having a shower. {'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0, 'neg': 0.0}
the other big dissapointment was the fact that you either wake up early and secure a pool bed or you would have to sit on chairs and tables.this being the end of the peak season i was shocked as i could not understand how they would have coped when the season was at its peak and the hotel full.how can a hotel have less pool beds than the guests they can accomodate? {'neu': 0.934, 'pos': 0.034, 'compound': 0.0258, 'neg': 0.033}
the food was okay and thus we had to eat out every other meal besides breakfast.i am not complaining about that as we had chosen bed and breakfast precisely for that reason as we like visiting other restaurants and sampling food from the region. {'neu': 0.872, 'pos': 0.128, 'compound': 0.6114, 'neg': 0.0}

we also visited thailand during the same holiday and will review the hotels in another review but suffice to say the quality of 3* hotels in both these countries vaires by a huge margin. {'neu': 0.866, 'pos': 0.134, 'compound': 0.5859, 'neg': 0.0}

the ronil is one of the best hotels in the baga/calangute areas, but right in the heart of the town and just a ten minute walk to the beach - unlike some of the new 5-star developments which have been described as "hermetically sealed"! {'neu': 0.934, 'pos': 0.066, 'compound': 0.4389, 'neg': 0.0}

if you like the beach, calangute and baga are crowded so take a ride to ashvem in the north or coco beach, south of candolim, which also offers dolphin spotting boat trips (much cheaper to book locally than through the hotels). {'neu': 0.94, 'pos': 0.06, 'compound': 0.3612, 'neg': 0.0}
